# Structuring bibliography

The bibliography lists the bibliographic references you have added to your article. To add your references, you must click on **[Manage]** in the left sidebar, to the right of the *Bibliography* tab. The *Bibliography Manager* tool opens and offers you several possibilities:

- **Zotero**: you can synchronize a bibliography by connecting Stylo to your Zotero account (groups/private or public collections). This is what we recommend! See below for more details.

- **Zotero**: you can import your bibliography from a Zotero collection of a public group by entering the URL of this collection.

- **Citations**: you can manually enter your bibliography in BibTeX format.

- **Raw BibTeX**: it is possible to correct BibTeX directly.

You can directly [structure your references in BibTex](http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/bibliographies), or export your references in BibTeX thanks to your bibliography management tool:

## Synchronize a Zotero collection

It is possible to synchronize the references of an article with a collection or sub-collection of your Zotero account or from a Zotero group (public or private). Here are the steps to follow:

1. In the left sidebar, on the *Bibliography* tab, click on **[Manage]**;
2. Connect your Zotero account with the option "Connect my Zotero Account";
3. A window opens, entitled "New Private Key", asking you to validate the connection between Stylo and Zotero: click on "Accept Defaults";
4. By activating the drop-down list, you can now choose a collection (or a sub-collection) from your Zotero account;
5. Click on the **[Replace bibliography with this account collection]** button to import the bibliographic references (they will appear in the left sidebar, under the *Bibliography* tab).

**Here are some important remarks about synchronization with a Zotero collection**:

- This function also allows you to import collections from public or private groups;
- You can't import more than one collection;
- Each synchronization or import overwrites your bibliographic data. If you use the synchronization option, we advise you to modify your references in Zotero and to import them again, and so on until you get the expected result;
- There is no automatic synchronization, you have to re-import each time you modify your references in Zotero.

## Insert a bibliographic reference

An autocomplete function is implemented. Just start typing `[@` or simply `@` and the text editor will propose all your references associated to the article. If you want to refine the autocompletion, you can add the first letter of the author's name to reduce the number of suggestions: `[@b`.

You can also click on the icon associated with the reference in the left pane, then paste it (Ctrl+V) in the text at the desired place. It will appear then as `[shirky_here_2008]`. To understand, a click consists in "copying" the BibTeX key of the reference in the clipboard.

Inserting a BibTeX key in the body text has two effects:

1. The key is automatically replaced by the correct formatted quote call in the body text, for example : (Shirky 2008).
2. The complete bibliographic reference is automatically added at the end of the document.

## General scenarios

The Markdown syntax allows you to finely structure your bibliographical references. Depending on your needs, here are different cases to produce the citation call:
- `[@shirky_here_2008]` will produce : (Shirky 2008)
- `[@shirky_here_2008, p194]` will produce : (Shirky 2008, p194)
- `@shirky_here_2008` will produce: Shirky (2008)
- `[-@shirky_here_2008]` will produce : (2008)

For example:

- If you want to quote the author + the year and the page in brackets:

| In the editor | In the preview|
|:--|:--|
|`Real space, the space of our material life, `<br/>`and cyberspace (which is certainly `<br/>`not so completely virtual) should not be `<br/>`called separately, since they `<br/>`interpenetrate each other more `<br/>`firmly [@shirky_here_2008, p. 194]. `|` Real space, the space of our material life,`<br/>` and cyberspace (which is certainly `<br/>`not so completely virtual) should not be `<br/>`called separately, since they `<br/>`interpenetrate each other more `<br/>`firmly (Shirky 2008, 194).`|

- If the author's name already appears, and you just want to add the year of publication in brackets:

|In the publisher | In the preview|
|:--|:--|
|`Clay @shirky_here_2008 [p. 194] suggested that real space,`<br/>` that of our material life, and `<br/>`cyberspace (which is certainly not so completely `<br/>`virtual) should not be called `<br/>`separate since they interpenetrate `<br/>` more and more firmly. ` | `Clay Shirky (2008, 194), suggested that real space, `<br/>`that of our material life, and `<br/>`cyberspace (which is certainly not so completely `<br/>`virtual) should not be called `<br/>`separate since they interpenetrate `<br/>` more and more firmly.`|

- To avoid repetition of a name, and to indicate only the year, put a `-' in front of the key.

|In the editor | In the preview|
|:--|:--|
|`Conceptual artists had tried to circumvent`<br/>` the rules of the art market (apparently`<br/>` without much success or`<br/>` without much conviction, if`<br/>` we are to believe Lucy Lippard [-@lippard_six_1973; -@lippard_get_1984])`<br/>` to circumvent the rules of the art market. ` | ` Conceptual artists had tried to circumvent`<br/>` the rules of the art market`<br/>` (apparently without much success or`<br/>` without much conviction according to Lucy Lippard (1973; 1984)) `<br/>` to circumvent the rules of the art market.`|
